# Contributing

A [Dynamit](http://dynamit.com) we like to jam on ideas and move forward together. The way we code evolves, and so should our standards. Here are the guidelines for contributing to the coding standards.

## Team-think

Any standard should be at least mostly agreed upon by the team(s) that it affects. No rogue developers. If you have an idea for a new standard or update to an existing standard, solicit feedback and work with the team to get alignment.

These standards are meant to be a baseline for development - to smooth the friction of multiple developers context-switching between projects. Agreement amongst the team is key.

These standards are not meant to be rigid. Resist the urge to overly-prescribe development practices, as that will inhibit autonomy and innovation.

## Setup

We use [Gitbook](http://gitbook) to publish our standards. The various build steps are scripted for convenience.

Initial setup (run once locally):

```
npm run prepare
```

Run local server and recompile changes on the fly (for local devlopment):

```
npm run serve
```

Building the documentation (to just produce build artifacts):

```
npm run build
```

Publish (build + deploy):

```
npm run publish
```
